# D1_E-ink
 
If you want to get the code working quickly. Just command out the "if(WiFi.status ..." part and edit the Config.h ssid en pass.

tis code has some fun stuff:
  - A small webserver. (2pages)
  - HTTP requests
  - Playing with time.
  - Images in unsigned char
  - Shows result on a e-ink

Stuff i used:
  - D1 mini
  - 2.7 inch e-paper HAT (264 x 176)
  - Openhab2 (for HTTP requests)
  
  Have fun!!
